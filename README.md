# GIWIK
Introducing to you a small project that's based on API. In this project we allow the user to search for whatever he wants (using Wikipedia's API) and then we display that info for him, in addition to this we display a GIF from Giphy (using Giphy's API) that's showing a relevant GIF for what he had searched.
